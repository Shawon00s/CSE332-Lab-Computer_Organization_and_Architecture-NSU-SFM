# 🔬 Lab Report 01  
## 🧪 Design and Simulation of a 2-bit Logic Unit

---

## 🎯 Objective
Design and simulate a **2-bit logic unit** capable of performing basic bitwise operations. The unit takes two 2-bit binary inputs and a select signal to perform logic functions like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

---

## 📘 Reference: Lab Manual

The original lab manual outlines the design of a **2-bit logic unit**, including:
- Truth tables for each logic operation
- Gate-level implementation
- Circuit diagram and functional explanation
- Theoretical background and learning objectives

## 📝 Task Description
> Design and implement a **2-bit logic unit** using logic gates.  
> The logic unit should perform multiple bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) based on a control signal.

## ⚙️ Logic Unit Operations

| Select Line | Operation |
|-------------|-----------|
| 00          | A AND B   |
| 01          | A OR B    |
| 10          | A XOR B   |
| 11          | NOT A     |

> Here, A and B are 2-bit binary inputs.

---

## 🔧 Design Steps

1. **Create truth tables** for each operation
2. **Develop logic expressions** for each output bit
3. **Implement logic circuits** using gates
4. **Simulate and verify** correct functionality of the logic unit

---

## 🧠 Boolean Expressions

Each logic function is derived using standard Boolean algebra rules. For 2-bit operands `A1A0` and `B1B0`, operations are performed bitwise.

---

## 🧪 Simulation Result

The simulated circuit successfully performs the intended bitwise logic operations depending on the select line inputs. Each output is verified against expected results.
